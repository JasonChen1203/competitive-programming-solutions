# competitive-programming-solutions
Solutions from online judges and past coding competitions. This is used to keep track of my progress in competitive programming and DS & Algo. Solutions are written mostly in Java and C++.
Solutions are not guaranteed to be space/time efficient (and yes, a lot of disgusting variable names in my early days), but they do lead to AC in their respective judges.
